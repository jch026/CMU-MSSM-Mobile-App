CMU MSSM Summer Programming Assignments - Mobile App

Single-screen mobile application called LugAway: a travel focused app that is utilized as a luggage storage service 
that will pick up your belongings and meet you at a time and place that best suits your travel itinerary.

The app currently displays the business name, details, and contact information.

Included in the project is a mp4 video file which shows the behavior of the application.
The video demonstrates that the UI supports adaptive design when opened on different mobile device sizes.
Additionally, the view automatically adjusts to support portrait and landscape mode.
